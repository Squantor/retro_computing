# Z80 test computer
This is my first foray into building a Z80 based computer. Inspiration brought by the [Collapse OS](https://collapseos.org/) project and to create a compact system where I can experiment with this OS. Goals is to create a simple salvagable computer where it would be feasable to do Collapse OS development on!
# HSI (Hardware Software Interface)
This applies to a project that has a embedded software component. Describe what each pin/bus does, what it is connected to, what its function is and some "safe" behaviour when starting up.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* Create HSI
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) (this size PCB is pretty expensive to manufacture at Oshpark)
* Assemble
* Test and install
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
