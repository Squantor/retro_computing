# G65SC151 Single Board Computer Version 0
This is a simple test board for the G65SC151 microcontroller chip. Goal is to bring up this chip and getting to know how to program it. Why? I have some retrocomputing projects planned, and I wanted to learn to program the 6502 processor. Instead of going for the standard 6502 with a RAM, ROM and ACIA/UART chip. The G65SC151 has a few facilities built in:
* 64 bytes of RAM
* 27 GPIO pins
* Interval timer
* Some modem communications block
* 6502 style bus interface
This makes it possible to make a working 6502 system with just adding a ROM chip. Neat!
# HSI (Hardware Software Interface)
Still TODO as schematic is still in progress.
## TODO's
Still some things need to be done:
* schematic entry 
* PCB layout
* Review with one night in between
* Produce
* Assemble
* Test & characterise
* update Readme.md with pictures and BOM
## BOM
The G65SC151 is a long obsolete microcontroller using the 6502 processor architecture. Replicating this project you will have to try your luck with a ebay/aliexpress.
